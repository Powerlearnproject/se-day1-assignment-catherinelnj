Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tool to develop and maintain software systems. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages, establishment of software engineering as a discipline and advent of structured programming 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements which involves gathrerine and documenting user needs and system requirements 
Design which involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architechture and user interface
Implementation which involves writing code and building the software
Testing which involves conduction various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
Deployment which involves releasings the software to users or customers
Maintainance which involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies involves sequential approach with distinct phases for example requirements, desing and implementation.
Agile methodologies involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by desinging and executing test plans 
Project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code for example visual studio
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements which can be mitigated with effective communication between the users and designers 
Tight deadlines which can be mitigated through prioritization of tasks 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is important to testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing tests interactions between different components or subystems 
System testing works on the entire software system as a whole 
Acceptance systems tests the sofware against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models 
Prompt engineering helps avoid confusing and vague answers and responses from the AI models 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'Explain the theory of change' versus 'Using peer reveiwed scholary articles, define the theory of change with current examples'
